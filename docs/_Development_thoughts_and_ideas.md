## Thoughts about where to go from here...

Make some notes...

#### Keep in mind
This is not going to be a full Nano replacement. This is intended to be a simple and small library to help a developer talk to  couch for the usual CRUD operations and a few other things.
All the other fancy stuff, go ahead and use Nano... or call CouchDB directly. I don't care about that stuff for now.

#### Possible names: (most are obviously a play on "couch")
**these are at lease unique:**
~~lazyboy~~ or lazyboi
~~loveseat~~
~~recliner~~
~~kickback~~
~~sofa~~
~~sofaking~~ or ~~sofa-king~~
**these are pretty dumb (even for me):**
maxicouch or maxi-couch
axiouch
axicouch or axi-couch
couchios
