#### Axiouch was written for CouchDB v1.6.1
The official CouchDB docs for v1.6.1 can be found [HERE](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/api/index.html)

The documents for Axiouch follow the Apache CouchDB docs as well as we can, sometimes word for word. If there is something that doesn't seem to be documented here please refer to the CouchDB docs to see if there is something that helps with your situation before submitting an issue.

Not everything that can be done with either Nano or directly with CouchDB can be done with Axiouch and that was kind of the point. This is a minimal library for the "ususal" CRUD operations.
